        <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and indulgent dish made with a rich béchamel sauce, which consists of butter, flour, and milk. This smooth and velvety sauce coats the pasta, giving it a luscious texture and a mild, buttery flavor. Often seasoned with salt, black pepper, garlic, and herbs like oregano or basil, the sauce can also be enhanced with cheese for extra richness. The choice of pasta can vary, but penne, fettuccine, and macaroni are commonly used. Vegetables like bell peppers, mushrooms, and broccoli can be added for more flavor and nutrition, while proteins like chicken or shrimp make it a wholesome meal.</p>

        <p>Originating from French and Italian cuisine, white sauce pasta has become a global favorite due to its creamy texture and versatility. It is easy to prepare and can be customized with different seasonings, herbs, and toppings to suit individual tastes. Whether served as a comforting homemade dish or enjoyed in restaurants, this pasta is perfect for both casual meals and special occasions. Paired with garlic bread or a fresh salad, white sauce pasta is a satisfying and delicious dish that appeals to all age groups.</p>
