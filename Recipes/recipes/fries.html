        <p>French fries, often simply called fries, are one of the most popular and beloved snacks worldwide. Made from potatoes that are cut into thin strips and deep-fried until golden brown, fries have a crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. They are commonly seasoned with salt and served hot, making them a perfect side dish or snack. While traditionally paired with ketchup, fries also go well with a variety of dips such as mayonnaise, cheese sauce, barbecue sauce, and even gourmet toppings like truffle oil and Parmesan cheese. Their versatility has led to countless variations, including curly fries, waffle fries, steak fries, and shoestring fries, each offering a unique texture and flavor experience.</p>

        <p>The history of fries is often debated, with both Belgium and France claiming to have invented them. Belgians argue that their ancestors fried potatoes in the late 17th century, while the French popularized them under the name "frites." Today, fries are a global favorite, found in fast food chains, fine dining restaurants, and even home kitchens. They can be baked or air-fried as a healthier alternative, though the classic deep-fried version remains the most popular. Whether served as a side to burgers, fish, or sandwiches, or enjoyed on their own with seasonings like chili powder, garlic, or herbs, fries continue to be a staple of comfort food enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
